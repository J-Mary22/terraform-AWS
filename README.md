# terraform-AWS script that includes an S3 bucket, a VPC, and an RDS instance:

#yaml code

#This script specifies that Terraform should use the AWS provider and that it should create an EC2 instance using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI (ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0) and a t2.micro instance type. The instance is tagged with the name "example-instance".

#This is just a simple example, but you could build on this script by adding more resources (such as an S3 bucket, a VPC, or an RDS instance), customizing the configuration of the resources, and using variables to make the script more flexible.

#To run this script, you would first initialize Terraform by running terraform init, then run terraform apply to create the resources. You can then use terraform show to see the state of the infrastructure, or terraform destroy to remove the resources when you're done.
