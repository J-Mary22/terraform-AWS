# Terraform-AWS script that includes an S3 bucket, a VPC, and an RDS instance:

# This script specifies that Terraform should use the AWS provider and that it should create an EC2 instance using the Amazon Linux 2 AMI (ami-0c55b159cbfafe1f0) and a t2.micro instance type. The instance is tagged with the name "example-instance".

# This is just a simple example, but you could build on this script by adding more resources (such as an S3 bucket, a VPC, or an RDS instance), customizing the configuration of the resources, and using variables to make the script more flexible.

# To run this script, you would first initialize Terraform by running terraform init, then run terraform apply to create the resources. You can then use terraform show to see the state of the infrastructure, or terraform destroy to remove the resources when you're done.

# This script creates an EC2 instance, an S3 bucket, a VPC, a RDS instance, a security group, and two subnets. The security group allows incoming traffic on port 3306 (for MySQL), and the RDS instance is associated with the security group and the subnet group. 

# The outputs provide the ID of the EC2 instance, the name of the S3 bucket, the ID of the VPC, and the endpoint of the RDS instance, which can be useful for connecting to the RDS instance from other resources.
